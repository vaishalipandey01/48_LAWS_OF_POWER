Separate him from the\n              group.\n              • In every group power is concentrated in the hands of one or two people.

Be alert to people’s\n              individual psychologies and their basic emotional responses.\n              • Maintain a stable of writers, artists, or intellectuals who are very good at\n              appealing to people’s hearts and minds.`\n}, {\n  id: 30,\n  title: `NEVER APPEAR TOO PERFECT.`,\n  idea: `• Never underestimate the power of envy. Occasionally reveal a weakness, defect,\n              or anxiety, or find new friends. It is the people in your own circle of peers who will\n              be the first to envy your success.\n              • Envy is often a problem for people who have great natural talent. You may think\n              you are charming people with your natural talent when in fact they are coming to\n              hate you for it.\n              • To deflect envy, employ a display of weakness, or a harmless vice.\n              • Envy is disguised sometimes as excessive praise, or slander and criticism. Win\n              your revenge by ignoring the envious.\n              • Reversal: Display the utmost disdain for those who envy you. Instead of hiding\n              your perfection, make it obvious.
